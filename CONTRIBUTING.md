# HCF
It is a PocketMine-MP plugin for 4.0.0, so any updates from the community will be welcomed (if they agree to our terms of collaboration)

Contributions must be submitted through **Github Pull Requests**, where collaborators will review them
 
Small contributions (For example: Code errors, Gameplay issues) are made by pull requests only.

Large contributions (For example: General crashes) are made forks only, for new feature implementations, they must go through our [Change Proposal](#change_proposal) so that the collaborators and the community decide if it is necessary to implement it or not

## Pull Request Reviews
Pull Requests will be reviewed when team collaborators are available, Please note that it may take a long time before the team of contributors review your Pull Request.

Based on your changes, contributors may ask you to update your Pull Request to fix issues or code improvements, **remember not to delete your fork** while the Pull Request is open, otherwise your Pull Request will be rejected and deleted

## Requirements 
The following is required as a minimum for pull requests,
pull requests that do not meet this requirement will be rejected by the contributor team

## Changes should be about just one thing
To add a change, only one fork should be created for that change in general 

## License
This plugin is licensed [GPL-3.0](LICENSE)
so the developers of this plugin will be able to see its code
means that you agree to distribute your code under the same license

## The pull request must not have changes Unnecessary/Not related to the plugin
Do not include changes that are not needed by the plugin, as those changes are difficult to review
This means:

• Do not reorganize the code already written

• Don't change things unrelated to the plugin goal

• Do not change the code already written just to make it look "Better"

## Change Proposal
Change proposals are problems and discussions, a function implementation or behavior changes, are used to have comments from collaborators and the community about a specific change, to decide if it is a good idea or not to implement it

### Send it Change Proposal
This part is under revision, please wait a bit to be able to finish it, this is essential for the development of hcf.
